Dear Hiring Team,
I’m excited to be applying for the Backend Software Engineer role on the Reserve team at Tango. I was referred by Heather Menzies and was immediately interested in contributing to a product that supports modern, flexible workplaces.
I recently completed a degree in Software Engineering with a focus on Java and built a full-stack portfolio project that reflects many of the technologies you use, including Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL, and containerized deployment. Through that project, I implemented authentication, role-based access control, and a RESTful API, gaining hands-on experience with building secure, maintainable backend systems. I’m continuing to grow my development skills and am eager to work in a professional environment where I can apply them at scale.
In addition to my software education, I bring six years of professional IT experience. Currently, I work as an Internal Systems Engineer at VC3, where I focus on infrastructure automation and scripting using PowerShell and Python. My work supports a remote-first MSP with over 1,800 clients across North America. I’ve also been involved in large-scale integration projects and frequently serve as an escalation point for complex technical issues. That background has shaped a pragmatic, systems-aware approach to development.
I’m a strong communicator, comfortable working remotely, and highly motivated to keep learning and building. I’d welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Reserve team and continue growing as an engineer at Tango.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best Regards,
Bradley Summers
